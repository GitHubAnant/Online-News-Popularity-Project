# Online News Popularity Project: To predict the Online News Popularity of mashable.com articles by no. of shares on the social media channels   

Executive Summary
* In order for online news companies like Mashable to succeed, they need to determine patterns and trends that contribute 
  to the popularity of their models. 
* Our goal was to create and develop a model predicting which Mashable articles were widely shared on social networks based
  on several features of online news. 
* Based on the results, we determined which variables would contribute toward future content creations having a wider reach 
  on social media through organic sharing. 
* Our business insights and recommendations for Mashable are based on our logistic regression model, which was implemented on
  a dataset built using stratified undersampling. 
* This model provides multiple insights and recommendations that will help Mashable improve their business. 
* These insights includes the impact of image insertions, article categorization, keyword strength, and article release day. 
* We then conclude with direction and specific actions Mashable could take to improve their articles’ virality.

Problem Statement
* Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company, and they post articles of multiple genres online from which
  they earn revenue from advertisers. 
* In order for companies like Mashable to succeed, they must be aware of the trends within their successful articles. 
* Without learning these trends, a company like Mashable may fail against competitors who also uses data-driven strategy. 
* Therefore, it is imperative to understand and predict what article characteristics are most appealing to readers. 
* Our solution to this problem involves predicting which articles are widely shared on social media. 
* Shares on social media is a key metric for article virality, and the specific business insight we are looking for is which 
  factors lead to higher article virality. 
* This is very significant for business because it results in more article views without requiring paid marketing.

Dataset Introduction
* The dataset is called “Online News Popularity Data Set” and it can be accessed from UCI Machine Learning Repository 
  (https://archive.ics.uci.edu). 
* Each row represents a news article and was collected from January 7, 2013 to January 7, 2015. 
* There are 39,797 rows and 61 columns as shown in the Appendix Table 1. 
* The original dataset contained 37 attributes of articles, and several natural language processing features were extracted 
  by previous researchers (Fernandes, Vinagre & Cortez, 2015). In this study, 17 selected predictors are used to build models.  

Methodology
* The methodology of this study is followed by SEMMA. SEMMA stands for Sample, Explore, Modify, Models, and Assess 
  (Shmueli, Bruce, Stephens & Patel, 2017, p. 18). 
* During this process, our data visualizations were created by both Tableau and JMP software, and the models were built via JMP software.
